# MVP Adote Patinhas 

<p>
This is a project that was developed using React.js, Next.js and Tailwind CSS. 
This front was presented in the TCC of my technical course where the objective would be to create a pet adoption website, we created this MVP in 1 week (4 hours a day) and delivered it. 
We aim to integrate with a backend and launch it so that the project can be fully supported.
